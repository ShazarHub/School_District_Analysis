# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 - PyCitySchools with Pandaas
## Overview
There were some evidences of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. Our job is to fix the math and reading scores, refractor to analysis. And report the overall analysis.
## Results

 - Average math score reduced by 0.1

Similar to the data above, we removed 461 students from Thomas High School summary. The largest change is the Per Student Budget.

# New Scores
Scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by size, scores by school type

Scores by grades : are going to be the same because we only removed one grade from one school. All the of scores from one school to another are realtively the same. The good thing is that the scores are over 75% which means the school has passing averages. The bad is that from the differences in data shows that there is not any improvement.

Scores by school spending :
